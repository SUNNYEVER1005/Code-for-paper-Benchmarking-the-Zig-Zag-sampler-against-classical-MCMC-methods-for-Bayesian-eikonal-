This repository contains code accompanying the paper "Benchmarking the Zig-Zag Sampler against Classical MCMC Methods for Bayesian Eikonal Earthquake Location." All scripts are implemented in MATLAB. The `main` script runs the homogeneous-model experiments and produces earthquake-location results using four different sampling methods. The `Plots` script generates the figures presented in the paper.
