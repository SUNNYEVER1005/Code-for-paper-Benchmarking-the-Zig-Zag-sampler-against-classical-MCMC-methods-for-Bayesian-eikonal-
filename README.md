This is one of the codes for the paper "Benchmarking the Zig-Zag sampler against classical MCMC methods for Bayesian eikonal earthquake location"
ALL codes are writtened by the MALTAB.
"main" is the main code, when you run it you can get the earthquake location results by 4 different sampling methods in the homogenous model.
Finally, the code of "Plots" can plot the figures of the results.
